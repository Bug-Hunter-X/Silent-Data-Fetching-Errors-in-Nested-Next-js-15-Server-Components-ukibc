# Silent Data Fetching Errors in Nested Next.js 15 Server Components

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Next.js 15 applications involving server components and nested data fetching.  When errors occur during data fetching in deeply nested server components, they might not propagate correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.  The example showcases this issue and provides a solution.

## Problem

The `serverComponentBug.js` file illustrates a scenario with nested server components, each making API calls.  If any API call fails, the error is not effectively handled, resulting in a silent failure.

## Solution

The `serverComponentBugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to effectively handle these errors.  It incorporates comprehensive error handling in each data fetching step and provides clear error messages to the user.
