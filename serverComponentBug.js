In Next.js 15, a rather uncommon bug can surface when using server components with deeply nested data fetching.  Imagine a scenario where you have multiple layers of server components, each fetching data from a separate API endpoint. If an error occurs during data fetching in one of the nested components, it might not properly propagate up to the top-level component, leading to silent failures or unexpected behavior. This is often due to improper error handling within the asynchronous data fetching logic of the server components.
